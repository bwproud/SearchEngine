YONG PUNG HOW CJ
 This case concerned a disposal inquiry in respect of three vehicles seized in the course of police investigations. During the inquiry, both the petitioners and the respondent claimed entitlement to possession of the vehicles. The district judge ordered that the vehicles be delivered to the respondent. The petitioners filed a petition for the revision of the order made below. I dismissed the petition and now give my reasons.
 2.
 A preliminary point
There seemed no agreement in the court below between the parties involved on the question whether the inquiry was held pursuant to s 386 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68) (the CPC) or s 392 of the CPC. In their submissions, the petitioners assumed s 386 of the CPC to be the applicable section. The respondent relied upon s 386 of the CPC on the first page of his written submissions but, later, in the same set of submissions, cited s 392 of the CPC as the applicable section. From the notes of evidence, the investigating officer appears to have thought the relevant section to be s `382` of the CPC. The district judge did not comment on which section he applied nor whether he acted in his capacity as a magistrate, as required by s 392 of the CPC, or as a district judge. During the hearing of the petition, counsel for the respondent cited s 392 of the CPC as the relevant section while counsel for the petitioner did not mention which section of the CPC the case involved.
 3.The relevant section is s 392 of the CPC. This is because no prosecution was commenced after the police investigations. Accordingly, there has been no `inquiry or trial in any criminal court` within the meaning of s 386 of the CPC. Previously, in 
Magnum Finance Bhd v PP
 
 
[1996] 2 SLR 523
 , I stated, for the same reason, that this is the disposal provision to apply in cases where there has been no prosecution. No prejudice, however, has been occasioned by the confusion in the court below, as the inquiry only concerned the disposal of property between rival claimants and this discretion is similarly exercised under both sections. No power peculiar to s 386 of the CPC was involved. I therefore proceeded to deal with the petition on the footing that the inquiry had been held pursuant to s 392 of the CPC.
 4.
 The law in respect of disposal inquiries held pursuant to s 392(1) of the CPC
Section 392(1) of the CPC is as follows: 
The seizure by any police officer of property taken under section 29 or alleged or suspected to have been stolen, or found under circumstances which create suspicion of the commission of any offence shall be forthwith reported to a Magistrate`s Court which shall make such order as it thinks fit respecting the delivery of the property to the person entitled to possession of it or, if that person cannot be ascertained, respecting the custody and production of the property.

 Thai Chong Pawnshop Pte Ltd v Vankrisappan 
 Magnum Finance Bhd v PP f 
Somewhat surprisingly, there is scant local precedent on the exercise of a magistrate`s discretion pursuant to s 392 of the CPC. 
 Magnum Finance Bhd v PP 
, which I mentioned earlier, is a case which really concerned s 386 and dealt only with the question of when s 392 of the CPC is to apply. Nevertheless, some of the precedents on s 386(1) of the CPC, insofar as they deal purely with the distribution of property between rival claimants, would seem applicable to disposal inquiries held pursuant to s 392(1) of the CPC. Using this approach, the following principles appear to be relevant to a disposal inquiry conducted under s 392 of the CPC: (i). A disposal inquiry is intended to be an inexpensive and expeditious manner of distributing items produced in the course of investigations or at trial: 
Thai Chong Pawnshop Pte Ltd v Vankrisappan
 
 
[1994] 2 SLR 414
 .
 (ii). Such an inquiry is not conclusive as to title. The rightful owner can and should assert his rights in a separate civil suit: .
 (iii). There is no right of appeal against an order made pursuant to a disposal inquiry: 
Sofjan & Anor v PP
 
 
[1970] 2 MLJ 272
 .
 (iv). Where there is a fundamental error occasioning a clear failure of justice, the court may exercise its revisionary jurisdiction: .
 6.From the preceding paragraph, it is clear that while the perimeters of a magistrate`s discretion and the High Court`s powers have been delineated with precision, no rules have been set out in respect of situations where entitlement to possession is disputed. In this connection, counsel for the petitioners advocated the approach found in the Indian case of 
Purshottam Das v State
 
[1952] Cr LJ 856
. In dealing with a provision of the Indian Criminal Procedure Code similar to the section under discussion, Desai J stated at p 860: 
A magistrate is not a civil court and has no power to decide disputes about title. There was nothing in s 523 to authorise a magistrate to decide which party is the rightful owner of the property. His enquiry is limited to finding which person is entitled to possession. 
 Once he ascertains the person from whose possession the property is seized, he must hold him to be entitled to its possession unless his possession was unlawful
. [Emphasis added.]
 7.The first part of the extract is unremarkable and I have no quarrel with it. It is clear from the local precedents and indeed, s 392 itself, that the magistrate may not make binding decisions about title to property. Counsel for the petitioners, however, relied on the portion highlighted in italics to set out a simple three-point test: first, the magistrate should ascertain the possessor at the time of seizure; secondly, he should ascertain if such possession was unlawful; and thirdly, in the absence of unlawful possession, the property should be returned as a matter of course to the person in whose possession it was immediately prior to seizure by the police.
 8.I cannot agree that a magistrate must be constrained to such a simplistic approach. Suppose, for example, that X, who holds title, loans his property to Y for a day, who would then be in possession as a lawful licensee. At the end of the day, the property is seized from Y during police investigations, through no fault of X or Y. Although Y would be the party in possession at the time of seizure, Y could not possibly dispute that it is X who is entitled to possession. Although Desai J`s observation that the magistrate is unable to decide questions of title is a correct one, the mere inability to
 decide 
 questions as to title does not and cannot lead to an inability to 
 have regard 
to the party who holds title. Title and possession are related concepts. In many cases, the right to possession arises from the fact of having title. In other cases, although a party holds title, he may not, for various reasons, be the party entitled to possession: for instance, if he has leased his property to another for a period which has not expired.
 9.In my view, a magistrate having charge of a disposal inquiry cannot abdicate his responsibilities by applying the three-step 
 Purshottam Das 
 test. He must look to the facts of each case to ascertain the party who is entitled to possession. In some cases, entitlement to possession will be plain from the facts presented. In other cases, he may not be so fortunate. But even where such entitlement is not clear from the evidence, the magistrate still ought to deliver possession to the party to whom, after a consideration of the evidence, appears to him to be entitled to possession. In such cases, the magistrate is severely handicapped by the lack of pre-inquiry disclosure of documents and evidence. As a result, his judgment must, in a sense, be exercised in a somewhat `rough and ready` fashion. This may be justified by the object of disposal inquiries, which is to achieve an expeditious method of distributing items no longer relevant to police investigations or court proceedings. It should be noted, in this context, as it was in 
 Thai Chong Pawnshop Pte Ltd v Vankrisappan 
, that the magistrate`s ruling has no effect on a civil court, which is the correct forum in which to test complex issues of fact and law. In such cases, any party aggrieved ought to commence civil proceedings. A petition for revision is not the appropriate route. As I said in 
 Magnum Finance Bhd v PP 
, the High Court`s power of revision is only exercised where there has been a fundamental error occasioning a clear failure of justice. It was with these principles in mind that I considered the petition for revision.
 10.
 The disposal inquiry in the court below
This disposal inquiry concerned a car with registration number SBU 2462 (the Nissan); a pick-up truck with registration number GJ 4328 (the pick-up); and a van with registration number YF 2867Z (the van). The Nissan was owned by one Sim Cheng Khim (Sim) (the deceased) whilst the pick-up and the van were owned by Golden Horse Trading Pte Ltd (Golden Horse), a dormant company owned by Sim. The Nissan was transferred to Sim`s husband, one Lee Eng Soon (the respondent) and the other two vehicles were transferred to his company, Jean Tex Trading Pte Ltd (Jean Tex) between August and December 1994. On 2 March 1995, Sim lodged a police report alleging that her signature had been forged on the instruments of transfer. In the course of the ensuing police investigation, the vehicles were seized from the possession of the respondent. Meanwhile, on 8 August 1995, Sim died. In her will, she bequeathed all her property `whatsoever and wheresoever situate` to her trustees to hold on trust for her mother. The two petitioners are the executors of her estate.
 11.After 18 months, upon the completion of their investigation, the police decided not to prosecute the respondent. A disposal inquiry was convened to distribute the three vehicles and both the petitioners and the respondent claimed entitlement to the vehicles.
 12.During the disposal inquiry, the investigating officer, S/S/Sgt Robert Kau, produced the police report in which Sim contended that the respondent had forged her signature on the transfer form for all three vehicles. He testified that he had sent the transfer forms for the pick-up and the van to the Department of Scientific Services (DSS) for signature analysis. On cross-examination by counsel for the respondent, he revealed that the form for the Nissan had not been sent because Sim had informed him that that was `her transfer form`.
 13.Counsel for the petitioners sought to prove the estate`s claim by adducing three categories of evidence: first, evidence that Sim`s signatures had been forged without her knowledge; secondly, her statements to the same effect, particularly those made in a will dated 7 February 1995; and thirdly, evidence that her relationship with her husband was poor prior to her death.
 14.In order to show that Sim had no prior knowledge of the transfer, an officer from the company from which the vehicles had been hire-purchased, Jeffrey Lim, was called. He testified that Sim telephoned Wayfoong Mortgage & Finance (S) Pte Ltd in January 1995 to enquire about the outstanding account for the Nissan. When informed that the account had been settled by a cash payment and the vehicles had been released to the respondent, she expressed surprise and said `it can`t be settled`.
 15.To prove that the signatures were forged, the DSS officer was called. He testified both in respect of the report he gave the police, as well as a later report requested by the executors. In the first report made for the purposes of the police investigation, he compared the signatures on the transfer forms for the van and pick-up with Sim`s specimen signatures. In the second report for the executors, he compared the release letter given to Wayfoong Mortgage by the respondent with Sim`s specimen signatures. He testified that the maker of the specimen signatures was not the same person as the maker of the signatures on the release letter and transfer forms. On cross-examination, he stated that illness could affect a person`s signature, but was of the view that none of the signatures exhibited was made by a person with terminal illness because the muscle control was still sound. He was of the opinion that the transfer form and release letter signatures were stiff and heavy, which could be the result of someone trying to imitate another`s handwriting. He was unable to conclude, however, that the respondent was responsible for the forgery. Owing to the fact that the specimen signature provided by the respondent was in Chinese, there was no basis for comparing the Chinese signature with the forged signatures.
 16.The second main area of the executors` evidence centred on the will dated 7 February 1995. By her will, Sim bequeathed all her property to her mother. At para 5, she explained her omission to provide for her husband in the following terms: 
I declare that my reason for making no provision in this my will for my husband Lee Eng Soon @ Lee Son is that there is no longer any husband-wife relationship between us since he fraudulently forged my signature and transferred my car to himself and also transferred my property Blk 7 #11-11 Melville Park Singapore to his mother without my prior approval.
 The solicitors who were responsible for drafting the will were called as witnesses. Jupiter Kong, former solicitor for Sim while he was at Lee & Lee, stated that the word `car` in para 5 ought to have been in the plural, because he was initially instructed in respect of the unlawful transfer of ownership of three cars and an apartment. On the other hand, Stacey Ong, who was responsible for drafting the will, testified that she had read the will to Sim on the telephone and Sim had confirmed that the will reflected her intentions.
 17.Both petitioners and a social worker named Cathy Lim were called to testify in respect of Sim`s complaints against the respondent. However, most of the questions asked were disallowed on the ground of hearsay and nothing of substance was adduced from these witnesses.
 18.The respondent, for his part, relied on the following four facts: that the police decided not to charge him with any offence; that he was and is the holder of the legal title; that he was in possession immediately prior to the seizure of the vehicles; and that all three vehicles were paid for by Jean Tex Trading Pte Ltd (Jean Tex), a company he now owns.
 19.The respondent`s evidence was that he married Sim in 1992. From sometime in 1990 until July 1994, he was an undischarged bankrupt. Both the pick-up and the van, he said, were purchased prior to his marriage. The pick-up was held in the name of Jean Tex, which was then owned by one Lee Jee Kok, and the van was owned by his mother. The pick-up was transferred, without fee, to Sim`s dormant company, Golden Horse, sometime in 1992 when Jean Tex was in financial trouble. The van was transferred to Golden Horse in 1992 also, again without fee, because his mother was `getting old`. The Nissan was purchased in Sim`s name in 1992, but he contended that Jean Tex paid for its purchase. Sim did not possess a driving licence. At all times, the three vehicles were used for the purposes and in the possession of Jean Tex. He became the proprietor of Jean Tex on 10 October 1994, after the annulment of his bankruptcy. He testified that Sim agreed to transfer the vehicles to him in late 1994, and furnished him with her identity card for this purpose. She signed the transfer forms and release letter in hospital, while he was out buying her lunch.
 20.At the end of the inquiry, the magistrate ordered that the vehicles be delivered to the respondent.
 21.
 The petition for revision
Counsel for the petitioners raised three main grounds for revision: first, that the magistrate had given insufficient attention to the DSS reports that Sim`s signatures had been forged; secondly, that insufficient emphasis had been placed on Sim`s statements in her will and to witnesses that the respondent had caused the unlawful transfer of the vehicles to himself; and lastly, as a related submission to the second ground, that the magistrate had erred in refusing to admit statements made by Sim to others about her relationship with the respondent and the respondent`s role in the transfer of her vehicles.
 22.In my view, the evidence in respect of the forged signatures was the most significant issue raised in the petition. Both in the court below and before me, counsel for the respondent made much of the fact that no prosecution has been brought against the respondent. This, in my opinion, was irrelevant. If the transfer forms had been forged, regardless of who had forged them or how they had been forged, it would appear that the title to the vehicles would have remained with Sim and, on her death, passed to her estate. Nevertheless, as a result of the aborted investigations, there has been no finding of fact in any court of competent jurisdiction that the transfer forms were indeed forged. For this reason, I looked very carefully at the evidence adduced to prove the forgeries. Unfortunately, I found the evidence unsatisfactory in several respects. On this point, the petitioners` case hinged on the DSS reports. The initial DSS report, however, only dealt with the transfer forms for the pick-up and the van. The Nissan form was excluded because, on S/S/Sgt Kau`s evidence, Sim had informed him that it was `her transfer form`. The omission of evidence on the Nissan transfer form was a serious lacuna in the petitioners` case. In an attempt to remedy the loophole, counsel for the petitioners then requested that the third form be sent as well. Owing to objections made by counsel for the respondent on the grounds that the magistrate had no power to order the further analysis, the magistrate refused the application. Nevertheless, on 23 April 1997, after the close of the respondent`s case, when the magistrate adjourned the hearing to 6 June 1997 for written submissions, he gave the petitioners leave to subpoena the DSS officer, if they thought fit. The DSS officer was called as a witness on 7 June 1997. It was at this hearing that he tendered his second report, dated 16 May 1997. In the report, he compared the signature on the Wayfoong Mortgage release form, which the respondent had tendered to obtain possession of the Nissan, with Sim`s specimen signature and concluded that the makers of both signatures were different. Again, no evidence as to the signature on the Nissan transfer form was led.
 23.In addition, there appeared to be some inconsistency in Sim`s various comments on the issue of the documents being forged. Although she reported to the police, the executors and Jupiter Kong that all three vehicles had been transferred without her authority, she informed S/S/Sgt Robert Kau that the transfer form for the Nissan was `her transfer form`. Moreover, para 5 of her will, drafted by Stacey Ong upon her specific instructions, referred only to `car` in the singular.
 24.This case was further complicated by both sides` treatment of the respondent`s evidence, through the production of cheque stubs and receipts, that Jean Tex had funded the initial purchase of the vehicles. Counsel for the respondent laid emphasis on this fact, but as I pointed out at the hearing, the log-book of a vehicle is its index of title: the funding of the purchases, without more, could not be a reason to deliver possession of the vehicles to the respondent. The respondent 
 could 
 have argued, based on such funding, that a resulting trust existed in his favour and that Sim, even prior to the transfers of title, was only a `bare trustee` with none of the benefits of ownership; that the respondent as the beneficial owner would have been entitled, at any point, to have asked for possession, and indeed, the transfer of the bare legal title to himself: see 
Saunders v Vautier
 
[1841] Cr & Ph 240
. This he did not do. His omission was complicated by the fact that this type of resulting trust is merely a presumption of intention which may be contradicted by evidence that the parties intended the contrary. Of relevance in the present case was the fact that Sim was the respondent`s wife and, as such, a `presumption of advancement` could be applicable to show that the husband intended the cars to be gifts: see 
Tinker v Tinker
 
[1970] 1 All ER 540
. This point was not taken by counsel for the petitioners either. In consequence, no evidence was led by either side as to the intent of the parties. For the petitioners, their omission may have arisen because Sim had informed them that she had paid for the cars and that her bag of documents was missing. Prior to the hearing, too, they were unaware of the respondent`s cheque stubs and receipts. As for counsel for the respondent, his omission may have arisen, in part, from his misplaced reliance on 
 Purshottam Das v State 
.
 25.From the preceding paragraphs, it would appear that there was a tremendous conflict of evidence which remained unresolved after the proceedings in the court below. No doubt some of the confusion may have been occasioned by the informal nature of a disposal inquiry and the ancillary lack of procedure for the proper discovery or inspection of documents found in civil and criminal proceedings. Be that as it may, I was not persuaded to exercise my revisionary jurisdiction, as it cannot, in the circumstances, be said that the magistrate`s decision resulted in a clear failure of justice. The respondent was the holder of the legal title and was in possession prior to the seizure. If the police had not seized the vehicles, the petitioners would have had the onus of commencing a claim in conversion and of proving the forgery. In order to prove that claim, proper discovery of documents would be necessary, the DSS reports would be perused in advance by the respondent, who would then be entitled to call his own expert to contest the allegations made. The respondent`s evidence as to payment would also be properly tested and any arguments in respect of a resulting trust or gift would be canvassed properly before the court. The magistrate`s order was merely a return to status quo and the petitioners are not constrained by this order in subsequent civil proceedings. Conversely, if the magistrate had ordered the delivery of the vehicles to the respondent, his order would have been limited to possession only. If it could be shown that notwithstanding the respondent`s legal title, he was plainly not entitled to possession, then mere possession would have sufficed for the petitioners` purposes. It was obvious from the evidence, however, that this was not the situation at hand.
 26.In my judgment, this case highlighted the inadequacy of a disposal inquiry as a forum to adjudicate complex issues of civil law. In such inquiries, there are no proper procedures for all pertinent issues to be set out and for evidence to be discovered and contested in an orderly fashion. This arises, no doubt, from their purpose, which is merely to distribute items no longer relevant to pending police investigations or criminal proceedings. Where it is plain from the facts and law which party ought to obtain possession, a magistrate`s failure to exercise his discretion correctly could be taken to be a fundamental error. Where entitlement to possession is complex, on the other hand, the magistrate must, by force of circumstances, do justice between the parties in a somewhat `rough and ready` manner. In such cases, canvassing the same issues again on a petition for revision is inappropriate.
 27.In the present case, upon receipt of information that the police were not proceeding with charges against the respondent, the petitioners ought to have commenced civil proceedings against the respondent for conversion immediately. If those proceedings had finished prior to the disposal inquiry and the petitioners had been adjudged the rightful owners, then it would have been a fundamental error for the magistrate to have ignored that finding. Even if those proceedings had not been completed prior to the disposal inquiry, several avenues would still have been open to the petitioners to allow them to protect their interest. First, they could have persuaded the magistrate to release the vehicles to the respondents on a bond to return them if the civil court should find favourably for the petitioners. This is an approach suggested by the Malaysian courts where an appeal is pending: 
PP v Peh Choo Key
 [1970] MLJ 136 . Alternatively, they could have persuaded the magistrate to retain the vehicles or their proceeds in the custody of the court, subject to any order of the civil court. This is the approach advocated by several Indian authorities: 
 Ramphal 
 40 CWN 862, 
 Ram Khalawan 
 28 CWN 1094, 
 Visa Samta 
 16 Cr LJ 111. I should mention that, in two of these cases, the order appears to have been made regardless of whether a civil suit was actually pending. This approach is not recommended, for, if no civil suit is commenced, the order would be of an uncertain duration. In any event, these possibilities were moot in the present case, because no civil proceedings were in fact afoot.","1997-10-13 00:00:00","SG High Court"

 The appellant was tried and convicted in the magistrate court on the following charge: 
You
 
Tan Lay Wah, F/34 yrs
 
NRIC NO: 1620089A
 
are charged that you, on 31 January 1997 at about 10.31pm at NTUC Fairprice, Blk 451 Clementi Avenue 3 #01-307, Singapore, being employed in the capacity of a servant, to wit, a groceries supervisor, did commit theft of ten cans of `New Moon` abalone, each valued at $32.80, with a total value of $328, in the possession of the manager, Tan Chin Chye, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under s 381 of the Penal Code (Cap 224).
 Section 381 of the Penal Code (Cap 224) states: 
Whoever being a clerk or servant, or being employed in the capacity of a clerk or servant, commits theft in respect of any property in the possession of his master or employer, shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to 7 years and shall also be liable to a fine.
 The appellant was convicted and sentenced to four weeks` imprisonment. She appealed against her conviction and sentence. I heard her appeal on 21 April 1998 and I allowed the appeal. I now give my reasons.
 2.
 The case for the prosecution
The prosecution`s case was as follows. On the morning of 31 January 1997, Nancy Tee, a supervisor at the Clementi branch of NTUC Fairprice (NTUC), told Basuri bin Rosidi (Basuri), the security officer of NTUC, that there were some cans of abalone inside a Foster beer box under the appellant`s table in the office. Nancy Tee instructed Basuri to keep an eye on the abalone. During the day, Basuri went into the office at half-hourly or hourly intervals to check the box.
 3.Sometime after 6pm on 31 January 1997, Lee Swee Siong (Lee), a deaf mute storehand in the grocery department of NTUC, saw the appellant taking ten cans of abalone and two cans of shark`s fin. He identified the cans in exh P3, a photograph of the abalone cans, as the cans he saw. Lee saw the appellant place the cans in a Guinness box and move the box under the table. He then walked over to Goh Ah Keok (Goh), a supervisor of NTUC, to sign to her what was happening. At about 6.10pm, Goh saw the appellant put the cans of abalone into two Royal biscuits tins. The tins were those featured in exh P2, a photograph of the abalone cans in biscuit tins. The appellant sealed both tins with scotch tape. After sealing the tins, the appellant put them into her plastic bag.
 4.At 10.30pm that day, Basuri checked the appellant as she was leaving. She was carrying two plastic bags, each with a Royal biscuits tin in it. The appellant showed Basuri the receipt for the two tins of Royal biscuits. Basuri returned the receipt and the appellant left.
 5.Nancy Tee checked the Foster box with the abalone cans a total of four times that day. Sometime after 10pm, she checked the Foster box and discovered that the cans were missing. The abalone cans which were missing were of the type shown in P3. She then informed Basuri that the abalone cans were missing. After checking two people who were leaving, Basuri ran out to look for the appellant.
 6.Basuri found the appellant at Clementi Bus Interchange ten minutes later. He informed her that he needed to re-check her biscuit tins. She asked `Why`. He replied that a few cans of abalone were missing. She gave him one of the tins. He checked and found abalone cans inside. The appellant did not say anything. Basuri asked her to follow him back to the store. She initially refused but agreed when Basuri said she might be able to speak to the branch manager and he might give her a chance.
 7.Once back at the office, Basuri handed over the appellant and the biscuit tins to NT Lingam (Lingam), the security manager of NTUC. Basuri then called Tan Chin Chye (Tan), the manager of NTUC, to inform him about the matter. He also asked P Mohd s/o P Ahmad (Ahmad), the security supervisor of NTUC, to call the police.
 8.Inside the manager`s office, the abalone cans were taken out of the biscuit tins. The abalone cans Lingam and Tan saw were those shown in P3. Tan also confirmed that NTUC did not sell the white and blue colour type of abalone similar to exh D4, an abalone can white and blue in colour.
 9.The appellant was escorted back to the station at about 11.23pm. The ten cans of abalone and two empty biscuit tins were seized as exhibits. These exhibits were subsequently handed over to Sergeant Tho Yeng Kok (Sgt Tho), the investigating officer. Sgt Tho asked Jumato bin Saad (Jumato) to photograph the exhibits. This resulted in exhs P2-P4. Sgt Tho returned the ten cans of abalone to Basuri on 3 February 1997. Sgt Tho proceeded to record the long statement from the appellant at about 1.10am on 2 February 1997. Woman Corporal Tan Siok Hoon was present at that recording. In the statement, the appellant admitted to the theft of the abalone cans.
 10.
 The case for the defence
The defence`s case was as follows. The appellant reported for work on 31 January 1997 at 2.24pm. Sometime after 5pm she left for dinner. She returned some time after 6pm. She bought her biscuit tins during her dinner break. According to the receipt they were bought at 6.35pm. She subsequently brought the biscuit tins back to the office and placed them under her table. Her evidence was that she could not remember whether there was anything underneath her table. She denied putting the abalone cans into the biscuit tins. She left work at 10.31pm.
 11.At Clementi bus interchange, Basuri stopped her, checked her biscuit tins and asked her to follow him back to the office. The appellant testified that the abalone cans that were taken out of the biscuit tins were blue and white cans similar to some specimens in court, D4. The appellant`s evidence was that abalone was one of the items under her charge and that abalone of the type similar to D4 was never sold in the supermarket. Only the type similar to another specimen D5, an abalone can chilli red in colour, and another specimen D2, an abalone can pink and blue in colour, were sold.
 12.The appellant denied stealing the abalone cans from NTUC. Her defence was that someone planted the cans in her biscuit tins to frame her.
 13.The appellant was not on good terms with some of the prosecution`s material witnesses, namely Lee, Basuri and Nancy Tee. Her relationship with Lee was poor because she had to scold him on occasions when he made mistakes. Her relationship with Basuri deteriorated after an argument over closing door shutters, and she had an argument with Nancy Tee over one of the appellant`s storehands.
 14.The appellant denied that her statement was made voluntarily. According to her, she was not allowed to visit the washroom during the three hour interview in the police station, even though she was suffering then from menstrual pains. She said that Sgt Tho threatened her with seven years` imprisonment and a fine if she did not sign the statement. Her evidence was that Sgt Tho offered to let her off with a warning and a fine if she signed the statement. She testified that she did not read the contents of the statement. After her release, she told her sister and brother-in-law about the incident. She testified that she attempted to contact Sgt Tho several times to correct what she signed but he refused to see her. She eventually made a police report on 8 May 1997, admitted as D6. A day before she was formally charged in court, she made a second police report.
 15.
 The magistrate`s findings
The appellant made several allegations of threats and inducement. The magistrate conducted a voir dire. After considering all the evidence, the magistrate was satisfied that the prosecution had proven beyond reasonable doubt that the statement had been given voluntarily and was not brought about by any threat, inducement or promise. The statement was admitted as PS2.
 16.One of the issues in contention was whether the abalone cans in question were those sold by NTUC. The actual cans had been returned to NTUC. The only evidence the prosecution had of the allegedly stolen cans were exhibit photographs P2 and P3. The defence`s contention was that the cans shown in P3 were white and blue, and that NTUC did not sell the white and blue colour type of abalone cans. Tan and the appellant had testified that NTUC did not sell the white and blue type of abalone cans. In cross-examination, Jumato was referred to P2 and questioned as to the colour of the cans. He answered that they were white and blue and further confirmed that the cans in P2 were similar to the blue and white type of D4.
 17.The magistrate made a finding of fact that the cans of abalone in P2 and P3 were the pink and blue type sold by NTUC and not of the type similar to the blue and white D4.
 18.
 The appeal
The crux of the appeal was this. Were the abalone cans in question of the type sold by NTUC? The appellant and Tan, the manager of NTUC, had testified that NTUC did not sell the white and blue colour abalone cans. They only sold the red cans, and the pink and blue cans. The only evidence the prosecution had regarding the allegedly stolen cans were photographs P2 and P3, the actual cans having been returned on 3 February 1997. In cross-examination, Jumato, the police photographer, testified that the cans in P2 and P3 were white and blue and confirmed that the cans in P2 were similar to those in D4. It was also conceded by the counsel for the prosecution that the cans in P2 and P3 appeared more white than pink. Examining P2 and P3, I was also of the opinion that the cans in P2 and P3 were white and blue in colour and not pink and blue.
 19.The prosecution submitted that the magistrate`s finding was supported by the appellant`s statement to the police, in which she admitted that the abalone seized from her belonged to the management of the supermarket. The prosecution also submitted that the magistrate`s finding that the abalone cans in P2 and P3 were sold by NTUC was reinforced by the fact that the appellant did not, at any stage before the trial, protest that the abalone seized from her did not belong to the supermarket. In effect the prosecution tried to prove that the abalone cans were in the possession of Tan, by relying on evidence from the appellant`s statement and on a single strand of circumstantial evidence arising from the appellant`s behaviour. I am of the view, however, that such evidence is contradicted by other evidence tendered by the prosecution themselves, namely the photographs P2 and P3 of white and blue abalone cans, the evidence of Jumato that the cans in P2 and P3 were white, and the evidence from Tan himself that NTUC did not sell the white and blue type of abalone cans.
 20.The totality of the evidence in this case was clearly that the cans in question in P2 and P3 were white and blue and of the type not sold by NTUC. In my judgment, the magistrate erred with respect to a material finding of fact when she found that the cans in P2 and P3 were the pink and blue type sold by NTUC.
 21.There was therefore no proof that the abalone cans were in the possession of Tan, the manager of NTUC. As a result the charge against the appellant was not made out. It is settled law that the test to be applied at the close of the prosecution`s case is that set out in 
Haw Tua Tau v PP
 
 
[1981] 2 MLJ 49
  [1980-1981] SLR 73 . At the end of the prosecution`s case the judge must consider whether 
 there is some evidence (not inherent incredible) which, if he were to accept as accurate, would establish each essential element in the alleged offence. If such evidence as respects any of those essential elements is lacking, then, and then only, is he justified in finding that `no case against the accused has been made out which if unrebutted would warrant his conviction `
 22.In this case, the prosecution failed to establish an essential element of the offence, in that they failed to establish that the abalone cans were in the possession of the appellant`s master. Accordingly the defence should not have been called.
 23.For these reasons, the appeal against conviction was allowed.","1998-04-29 00:00:00","SG High Court"

 2.
 Facts
The appellant was involved in an accident on 2 January 1996 at about 12am, at the junction of Yishun Avenues 5 and 2. He was in the process of negotiating a right turn into Yishun Avenue 2 from Yishun Avenue 5 when a motorcycle travelling along Yishun Avenue 2 collided into the rear left door of the appellant`s car. The appellant drove on without stopping. The motorcyclist and the pillion rider sustained fractured limbs and were taken to hospital.
 3.The accused was later arrested and his blood was found to contain 149mg of ethanol per 100ml of blood. He pleaded guilty to the following charges under the Road Traffic Act (Cap 276, 1994 Ed): 
(a) Driving under the influence of drink under s 67(1); and 
(b) Failing to render assistance to persons injured in an accident under s 84(3).
 The following charges were taken into consideration: 
(a) Failing to stop a vehicle in an accident under s 84(1); and 
(b) Moving a vehicle involved in an accident under s 84(4).
 He was sentenced to one month`s imprisonment and ten years` disqualification from driving and fined $800. On appeal to the High Court, the sentence of one month`s imprisonment was set aside and a fine of $5,000 was imposed.
 4.In March 1997, the witnesses to the accident were interviewed on the local television program `Code Red`. The matter was then referred to the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau (CPIB) by the Television Corporation of Singapore.
 
 The prosecution`s case
Ng Geok Hock (PW1)
 5.Ng testified that he was driving his taxi along Yishun Avenue 5 when he witnessed the accident. After the appellant had completed the turn into Yishun Avenue 2, the appellant slowed down before picking up speed again and driving off. When Ng saw the appellant driving off, he followed the appellant`s car. The appellant turned into a side road with a no entry sign. Ng followed him. The appellant then turned right into the Yishun bus interchange. Ng flashed the headlights of his taxi and sounded his horn to try to get the appellant to stop. When the appellant was close to the exit of the interchange, Ng drove alongside the appellant`s car. The appellant then stopped. Ng parked his taxi in front of the appellant`s car to prevent him from driving off. Both drivers alighted from their vehicles.
 6.Ng asked the appellant in a mixture of English and Hokkien why he had `hit and run`. The appellant replied, `No` and said that he wanted to give Ng money to let him go. By this time, Ng had already called the police on his handphone and reported the matter. He therefore told the appellant that he had already called the police and was waiting for their arrival. Under cross-examination, he admitted that he could not remember the exact words of the conversation. But he was adamant that the appellant had offered him money to let him go and that this offer had been made two or three times. He was also adamant that the appellant had made the offer before he had told the appellant that he had already called the police.
 7.Ong (PW2) and Susan Goh (PW4) then arrived on the scene. He overheard part of the conversation between Susan Goh and the appellant. Susan Goh asked the appellant why he had not stopped after knocking somebody down and had instead run away. The appellant then offered her money if she let him go. Susan said that she did not want his money.
 Ong Siong San (PW2)
 8.Ong was driving his taxi along Yishun Avenue 5 when he witnessed the accident. He drove after the appellant`s car. He followed him into the side road with the no entry sign all the way into the interchange. He parked his taxi behind the appellant`s car. He saw the appellant and Ng talking but could not hear their conversation. He asked the appellant if he was trying to run away after knocking somebody down. The appellant replied that he did not know what had happened and that he was not trying to run away. Ong then asked him why he had ignored the no entry sign if he was not trying to run away. The appellant remained silent. Susan Goh then arrived. Ong then went back to the scene of the accident. When he returned to the interchange, he saw Ng and Susan Goh scolding the appellant. He heard them say that the appellant had knocked somebody down, failed to stop and was still trying to run away. He also heard them say, `Your money very big.` Susan Goh then told him that the appellant had offered them money to let him go. Ong became very angry and scolded the appellant for trying to escape after knocking down somebody. Ong also said, `Your money is so big. Two lives are involved.`
 9.Under cross-examination, Ong said that when they were scolding the appellant, his 
 impression 
 was that he told them to let him go. It was also his 
 impression 
 that Ng had already reported the matter to the police. Under further cross-examination, Ong said that the appellant 
 had 
asked them to let him go home. Ong later clarified this, saying that the appellant 
 had 
 pleaded with them to let him go. Under re-examination, Ong further claified this, saying that the appellant 
 was 
 trying to tell them to let him off. None of this was in Ong`s evidence-in-chief.
 10.At this point counsel for the defence applied to recall Ng so as to put to Ng that he, similarly, merely had an 
 impression 
 that the appellant was asking Ng to let him go. Counsel for the prosecution objected on the ground that Ng had already been cross-examined extensively on whether the appellant had asked Ng to let him go. The trial judge agreed and refused the application.
 Susan Goh Soon Bee (PW4)
 11.Susan Goh was in a car driven by her sister Goh Quek Bee (Goh) (PW3) when she witnessed the accident. When the appellant failed to stop, she ran after his car to try and record the appellant`s registration plate number. She arrived at the interchange to find the appellant talking to two taxi drivers, Ng and Ong. She said that one of the taxi drivers had asked the appellant why he had failed to stop after knocking down somebody. The appellant asked him not to report the matter to the police. The taxi driver said that the matter must be reported. The appellant then offered them money in return for not reporting the matter to the police. Under cross-examination, Susan Ong was adamant as to what the appellant had said as well as to the sequence of the conversation. The appellant had asked them not to report him to the police and that he would give them all money if they all let him go. The taxi driver had then told the appellant that he had already reported the matter.
 12.The appellant then spoke to Susan Goh alone and asked her to speak to the other taxi drivers on his behalf. He told her that he would give all of them money if they let him off. Under cross-examination, she was adamant that the offer of money had been made to all three of them and not to her alone, and that the appellant had gesticulated in the direction of the two taxi drivers when making the offer.
 Goh Guek Bee (PW3)
 13.Goh was driving her car with Susan Goh beside her when she witnessed the accident. Susan had got out and run after the appellant`s car. When Susan returned, she was very angry and told her how the appellant had offered them money to let him go and how the appellant had approached her to reason with the taxi drivers on his behalf.
 The appellant`s statements
 14.The appellant viewed a recording of the program `Code Red` before making a statement under s 27 of the Prevention of Corruption Act (Cap 241, 1993 Ed). The material parts of the statement are as follows: 
3 On that night, after I realised that I hit an object at the junction of Yishun Ave 2 & 5, I turned to Yishun Bus Interchange and stop there. Soon I realised that there were two taxi drivers parked in front and back of my vehicle. They started scolding me for not stopping after hitting the motorcycle. Later, one lady join them. The lady was very angry and aggressive. At that moment, I thought that the lady was related to the motorcyclist. 
4 I was in a state of shock and panic after they told me that I had hit a motorcycle. I pleaded with them not to report to the police. I remember clearly that I told them to `talk about it` first before reporting to the police. What I meant was that if they demanded money I would give it to them. One of the taxi drivers told me that he had already reported to the police. In the process of pleading with them, I might have told them that I would offer them money if they could let me go. I did not remember how much I was going to give them to let me go. I cannot remember how actually I phrased the sentence. I was in the lost and I did not know what I was saying. 
5 I wish to say I do not normally behave that way. I was not in the right frame of mind after the accident. I was also very high at that time after consumption of alcohol.
 15.In his cautioned statements to the two charges, the appellant simply said that he would like to consult his lawyer.
 16.
 The defence
The appellant gave evidence on his own behalf. He testified that he had heard a thud sound coming from the rear of his car when he was turning right into Yishun Avenue 2. He slowed down momentarily and glanced at his rear view mirror and also took a half glance to the rear, but saw nothing. Nonetheless, he wanted to stop the car to see if any damage had been done to the car. He had turned into the side road so that he could stop the car. He had not seen the no entry sign. He was intending to stop the car when he saw a vehicle behind him flashing its headlights. He thought he was obstructing the vehicle and so he drove on. When the vehicle came alongside his car and sounded its horn, he immediately stopped the car and got out. The driver of the vehicle, whom he identified as Ng, also alighted.
 17.Ng asked him why he had not stopped after hitting a motorcycle. The appellant was shocked at the accusation as he had not realised he had hit a motorcycle. But Ng insisted that he had done so and that he had reported the matter to the police. The appellant asked Ng why he had reported the matter to the police when the appellant had not seen any such accident. If indeed there was such an accident, he should go and render assistance. However, Ng insisted that he stay put.
 18.Another vehicle then drew up behind his car. The driver, whom he identified as Ong, alighted and accused the appellant of running away after hitting a motorcycle. There followed a stream of such accusations from Ng and Ong.
 19.He next heard a woman, whom he identified as Susan Goh, screaming loudly and gesticulating wildly. He thought that she was one of the accident victims. He apologised to her and offered her money as compensation. He was however not sure whether he had actually used the word `compensation`. He asked her how much she needed. He also told her not to call the police as he thought that it was only a minor accident. Susan Goh was very angry and rejected his offer, saying, `You think your money so big.`
 20.The appellant then realised that Susan might not be one of the victims of the accident. The appellant claimed that one of the prosecution witnesses had mentioned that two people had been injured in the accident. He then asked Susan Goh to discuss with `them` how much they wanted. He explained that by `them`, he meant the accident victims, and he had emphasised this by gesticulating towards the scene of the accident.
 21.As regards his statement recorded under s 27 of the Prevention of Corruption Act, the appellant claimed that at the time the statement was recorded, he had been unable to recall what had happened at the bus interchange. When asked by his counsel why he had stated `in the process of pleading, I might have told them that I would offer them money if they could let me go`, he said that the witnesses had been very convincing on the program `Code Red` when they accused him of offering them money to let him go, so much so that he had begun to doubt himself. As such, he had taken a conciliatory stance even though he did not believe that he would bribe anyone. However, once he had heard the witnesses give evidence during the trial that he had said, `Let me go, I give you money`, he stopped doubting himself and was convinced that he had not tried to bribe them. As for his cautioned statements, he said that he had been shocked and his first reaction was to consult a lawyer. He was also afraid that he would say the wrong things in his statements.
 22.
 Decision below
The trial judge examined the photographs of the damage done to the appellant`s car and found that the appellant must have been aware of the collision with the motorcycle. Further, the appellant`s conduct after the collision had taken place showed that he had been aware of the collision. The trial judge went on to weigh the evidence of the prosecution witnesses against that of the appellant. The trial judge noted that the appellant had conceded in his statement recorded under s 27 of the Prevention of Corruption Act that he might have made an offer of money in return for being let off. The trial judge also drew an adverse inference against the appellant for failing to mention the material particulars of his defence in his cautioned statements. In the result, the trial judge accepted the evidence of Ng, Ong and Susan Goh and disbelieved the appellant`s defence. The trial judge accordingly convicted the appellant on both charges and imposed a fine of $15,000 in respect of each charge.
 23.
 The appeal
The appellant appealed only against his convictions and not against his sentences. On appeal, counsel for the appellant raised the following issues: (a). the trial judge`s findings of fact;
 (b). her refusal to allow counsel for the defence to recall Ng;
 (c). the drawing of an adverse inference against the appellant under s 123 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68); and
 . whether the offer of money was for a corrupt purpose.
 24.It is useful at this stage to reiterate the principles governing an appellate court`s role in reviewing the trial judge`s findings of fact. It is trite law that an appellate court should be slow to overturn the trial judge`s findings of fact, especially where they hinge on the trial judge`s assessment of the credibility and veracity of witnesses, unless they can be shown to be plainly wrong or against the weight of the evidence. This is borne out by s 261 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68), which states that no judgment, sentence or order of a district court or magistrate`s court shall be reversed or set aside unless it is shown to the satisfaction of the High Court that the judgment, acquittal, sentence or order was either wrong in law or against the weight of the evidence, or, in the case of a sentence, manifestly excessive or inadequate in the circumstances of the case. In 
Lim Ah Poh v PP
 
 
[1992] 1 SLR 713
 , FA Chua J, delivering the judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeal, held at p 719: 
An appellate court will not disturb findings of fact unless they are clearly reached against the weight of the evidence. In examining the evidence, an appellate court has always to bear in mind that it has neither seen nor heard the witnesses and has to pay due regard to the trial judges` findings and their reasons therefor.
 Similarly, in the case of 
Tan Chow Soo v Ratna Ammal
 
 
[1969] 2 MLJ 49
 , in which findings of fact depended on the credibility and veracity of witnesses, Lord Diplock, delivering the judgment of the Privy Council, held that an appellate court should be reluctant to overturn findings made by the trial judge because they are in a less advantageous position as compared to the trial judge who has had the benefit of hearing the evidence of the witnesses in full and observing their demeanour. The upshot of these cases is that factual findings of fact are prima facie correct and will not be lightly disturbed in the absence of good reasons. Then again, when it comes to inferences of facts to be drawn from the actual findings which have been ascertained, a different approach will be taken. In such cases, it is again trite law that an appellate judge is as competent as any trial judge to draw any necessary inferences of fact from the circumstances of the case. With these principles in mind, we turn to the appeal proper.
 25.
 Whether the appellant knew that he had been involved in an accident at the time the offer of money was made
The appellant`s first contention was that the trial judge erred in finding that the appellant had been aware of the accident and had attempted to run away from the scene of the accident.
 26.The trial judge relied heavily on (a) the damage to the appellant`s car and (b) the appellant`s behaviour immediately after the accident.
 27.The trial judge found that the damage to the rear door of the appellant`s car was so extensive that it was inconceivable that the appellant could have been unaware of the collision with the motorcycle. In response, the appellant contended that (a) his car was an extremely heavy vehicle, being a Mercedes S300, (b) the car radio was on and (c) he was intoxicated at the time and so the collision had not been apparent to him. He had merely heard a thud. After examining the photographs of the damage to the appellant`s car, I was of the view that the appellant must have been aware of the collision. The entire rear door had caved in, and judging by the fact that both the riders of the motorcycle had been flung off in the collision and suffered multiple fractures, the impact must have been substantial enough to capture the appellant`s attention. The appellant claimed in his evidence-in-chief that he had looked back and seen nothing. This was rejected by the trial judge and she was, in my view, fully justified in doing so.
 28.The trial judge also found that the appellant`s behaviour immediately after the collision showed that he was aware of the accident and was trying to run away. The appellant had driven into a side road despite the presence of a no entry sign and had continued driving into the Yishun bus interchange. He had driven to the end of the interchange and had only stopped when Ng drew alongside him in his taxi. The appellant explained in his evidence-in-chief that, having heard a thud, he had wanted to stop the car to check if his car had been damaged. He had not seen the no entry sign. The reason why he had stopped only when Ng had drawn alongside him was because Ng had been flashing his headlights at him and he thought he was obstructing Ng`s way. The appellant`s explanations were rejected by the trial judge. She found that the appellant`s actions were explicable only as those of a person trying to run from an accident scene. In particular, she noted that the appellant could not have been obstructing Ng`s way as the bus interchange was extremely wide with plenty of room to overtake. I agreed with the trial judge`s findings. The appellant`s actions were explicable only as those of a confused and panic-stricken person trying to run from the scene of an accident. If he had merely heard a thud, as he claimed he did, he must have thought that the damage, if any, to his car would be minor. Why then would he take the trouble to ignore a no entry sign and turn into a bus interchange to stop the car to check for damage?
 29.In any case, the essential element to be established was that the appellant knew that he had been involved in an accident 
 at the time 
 the alleged offer of money to the prosecution witnesses took place, the purpose of which was to induce the witnesses to let him go so that he could escape the consequences of being involved in the accident. Ng testified that he had accused the appellant of running away after colliding with a motorcycle 
 before 
 the offer of money had taken place. Ong had also levelled the same accusation at the appellant. The appellant claimed in his evidence-in-chief that he had not believed their accusations. Yet he had failed to take the simple step of checking his car for damage to satisfy himself that he had not been involved in such an accident. The appellant later said in his evidence-in-chief that he had initially thought that Susan Goh was of the victims of the accident. In other words, the appellant had come to accept that he had been involved in an accident with a motorcycle. Therefore, even if the appellant had not been aware of the accident before his encounter with Ng, Ong and Susan Go at the bus interchange, the appellant must nonetheless have been aware of the accident at the time the offer of money was made.
 30.
 Whether the appellant had offered a gratification to Ng
The trial judge found that Ng had consistently maintained that the appellant had offered him money to let him go and that the offer had been repeated two or three times. On the other hand, the trial judge found that the appellant had taken four inconsistent positions as to whether he had offered money to Ng.
 31.The appellant contended that the trial judge had erred in so finding. I was unable to accept the appellant`s contention. The appellant had first stated in his statement recorded under s 27 of the Prevention of Corruption Act that he might have made an offer of money. Later, he recanted and explained that he had been swayed by the witnesses` account of events on the program `Code Red` and that he was now sure that he had not made such an offer. When asked in cross-examination whether he had made an offer of money to Ng, the appellant said that he could not recall. Yet, under re-examination, when asked again whether he had made an offer of money to Ng, the appellant claimed that he had not done so. In my judgment, the trial judge was fully justified in finding that the appellant`s answers were inconsistent and unsatisfactory.
 32.The appellant next contended that the trial judge had attached insufficient weight to the inconsistencies in Ng`s evidence. In particular, during Ng`s examination-in-chief, he had stated that the appellant had replied, `No` when he had accused him of running away after knocking down a motorcycle, whereas under cross-examination he had said that he could not recall if the appellant had denied being involved in the accident. The short answer to this is that the discrepancy was an immaterial one which did not detract from the general veracity of Ng`s evidence. The trial judge was perfectly entitled to treat the discrepancy as trivial and to ignore it: 
Chean Siong Guan v PP
 
 
[1969] 2 MLJ 63
 . As this court noted in 
PP v Kalpanath Singh
 
 
[1995] 3 SLR 564
  at p 579: 
Adequate allowance must be accorded to human fallibility in retention and recollection. It is also common to find varying accounts of the same incident by the same person. No one can describe the same thing exactly over and over again.
 33.The appellant next contended that when he had asked Ng to let him go, he had only wanted to be allowed to go the scene of the accident. The trial judge had rejected the appellant`s construction of the words `let me go`. She noted that the evidence of Ng and Susan Goh that the appellant had not asked to return to the scene of the accident was unchallenged. In fact, Susan Goh had asked the appellant to return to the scene of the accident, only to be told by the appellant that there was no need to do so as the accident was not a serious one. The appellant claimed to have used the words `let me go to render assistance`. However, none of the other witnesses testified that they had heard him use the words `render assistance`, and this was never put to them in cross-examination. In my view, the trial judge was fully justified in rejecting the appellant`s construction of the words `let me go`. If the appellant had truly wanted to return to the scene of the accident, he could have made his intentions much clearer and asked Ng or any of the other witnesses to accompany him back to the scene of the accident.
 34.
 Whether the trial judge erred in refusing to recall Ng
The appellant next contended that the trial judge should have allowed the defence to recall Ng so that he could be cross-examined as to whether his evidence was that the appellant had 
 in fact 
 offered him money, or was it merely his 
 impression 
 that the appellant had offered him money. The trial judge refused the application on the ground that Ng had already been extensively cross-examined on the issue and had maintained throughout that the appellant had in fact offered him money.
 35.The court has a discretionary power to recall a witness if the evidence of the witness appears to the court essential to the just decision of the case: s 399 Criminal Procedure Code. In my judgment, the trial judge exercised her discretion correctly in refusing to recall Ng. Ng had already been cross-examined repeatedly on the issue in question and maintained throughout that the appellant had in fact offered him money. It would be fruitless to recall him only for him to give the same evidence all over again. Ng would in effect be simply re-stating his evidence, and this has been held to be highly irregular and recognised as a valid ground for refusing to recall a witness:

 Whether the appellant had offered a gratification to Susan Goh
Susan Goh testified that the appellant had offered money to Ng, Ong and herself to let him go and not report the matter to the police. She also testified that the appellant had later approached her and asked her to speak to the other taxi drivers. He told her that he would give all of them money if they let him off. Under cross-examination, she was adamant that the offer of money had been made to all three of them and not to her alone, and that the appellant had gesticulated in the direction of the two taxi drivers when making the offer. The appellant on the other hand claimed that he had thought that Susan Goh was one of the victims of the accident and he had therefore offered money to her as compensation. When he realised that she was not in fact one of the victims, he had approached her to negotiate with the accident victims on his behalf, and had gesticulated in the direction of the accident scene to emphasise his point.
 37.The trial judge rejected the appellant`s version of events. I found that the trial judge was perfectly justified in doing so. If the appellant had truly thought that Susan Goh was one of the accident victims, one would have thought that he would be extremely apologetic and would ask about her condition and if anyone else was hurt. Yet the appellant had failed to do so. As for the appellant asking Susan Goh to negotiate on his behalf, it seems to me incredible that the appellant should ask a complete stranger who was obviously hostile towards him to negotiate on his behalf. Moreover, at this point in time, he had no inkling as to the seriousness of the accident and the extent of the injuries suffered by the accident victims. It would have made far more sense for him to ask the witnesses to accompany him to the scene of the accident so that he could assess the situation and deal directly with the victims. Further, he had not mentioned this aspect of his defence in his cautioned statements or in his statement recorded under s 27 of the Prevention of Corruption Act. The trial judge was perfectly entitled to draw an adverse inference against the appellant for his failure to mention these facts.
 38.
 Whether an adverse inference should have been drawn under s 123 of the Criminal Procedure Code
The appellant contended that the trial judge should not have drawn an adverse inference from his failure to raise the material aspects of his defence in his cautioned statements. His explanation was that he had wished to consult a lawyer first and did not want to say the `wrong things`. I found this explanation to be completely unacceptable. The whole purpose of s 123 is to compel the accused to outline the main aspects of his defence immediately upon being charged so as to guard against the accused raising defences at trial which are merely afterthoughts. If the accused is allowed to escape the consequences of s 123 simply by explaining that he had wished to consult a lawyer first before saying anything, s 123 would be rendered otiose. I would emphasise at this point that it is not in every case that an adverse inference is drawn against an accused who keeps silent upon being charged. An adverse inference will be drawn only if he fails to mention facts which he could reasonably have been expected to mention upon being charged. In the instant case, the appellant had failed to mention in his cautioned statement that he had thought Susan Goh was one of the victims of the accident, that he had offered her compensation and that he had later asked her to negotiate with the victims of the accident on his behalf. It must have been evident to the appellant, even without the benefit of consultation with a lawyer, that these facts afforded a legitimate explanation for the offers of money he allegedly made, and that it would be in his interest to mention them. These were thus facts which the appellant could reasonably have been expected to mention upon being charged, and the trial judge was perfectly entitled to draw an adverse inference against the appellant under s 123 for failing to mention these material aspects of his defence in his cautioned statements.
 39.
 Language barrier
The appellant contended that he had spoken to the prosecution witnesses in a mixture of Hokkien and English and that he might have been misunderstood as he was not fluent in Hokkien. However, the appellant had himself conceded under cross-examination that he did not think the prosecution witnesses had misunderstood him. The prosecution witnesses were adamant as to what the appellant had said to them, and it was never put to them in cross-examination that they might have misunderstood the appellant because of linguistic difficulties. The trial judge was fully justified in finding that there had been no misunderstanding despite the appellant`s lack of proficiency in Hokkien.
 40.
 Whether the offer of money was for a corrupt purpose
Finally, the appellant contended that the offer of money was not for a corrupt purpose within the meaning given to offences under the Prevention of Corruption Act. I found this contention to be utterly without merit. It is well established that the word `corruptly` inserted within s 5(b)(i) of the Prevention of Corruption Act qualifies the offence in a significant manner. There must be a corrupt element in the transaction itself, and the offer of the gratification must be accompanied by a corrupt intent: 
PP v Khoo Yong Hak
 
 
[1995] 2 SLR 283
 . As to the first limb, whether a transaction had a corrupt element is an objective inquiry based on the ordinary standard of the reasonable man. This question is to be answered only after the court has inferred what the accused intended when he entered into the transaction. In determining whether the transaction had a corrupt element according to the ordinary and objective standard, it is useful to keep in view the natural and ordinary meaning of the word `corrupt` as a working guide, albeit with the qualification that this is not exhaustive: 
Chan Wing Seng v PP
 
 
[1997] 2 SLR 426
 . For present purposes, it suffices to note that one of the meanings of `corrupt` as defined in 
 The Oxford English Dictionary 
 is: 
To destroy or pervert the integrity or fidelity of (a person) in his discharge of duty; to induce to act dishonestly or unfaithfully; to make venal; to bribe.
 41.In the instant case, the appellant had intended to escape criminal liability in exchange for money. Such a transaction is clearly corrupt based on the ordinary standard of the reasonable man. Firstly, it is in substance a transaction in the nature of a bribe. Secondly, it is akin to an attempt to subvert the course of justice; the appellant clearly believed that he could bargain with the witnesses to his criminal acts and buy their co-operation if he was willing to pay the right price. In short, the appellant had sought to attach a monetary value to the witnesses` integrity and sense of justice. For these reasons, I had no hesitation in finding that the offer of money was for a corrupt purpose.

YONG PUNG HOW CJ
 The appellant, a corporation, was convicted after a trial for carrying on insurance business in Singapore as an insurance agent for British United Provident Association Ltd (BUPA), which was an insurer not registered with the Monetary Authority of Singapore, an offence under s 33(1) Insurance Act (Cap 142, 1994 Ed). It was fined a total of $22,000. The appellant appealed against the conviction and sentence. The only issues on appeal were: (1) whether the appellant was acting as an insurance agent carrying on insurance business in Singapore for BUPA; and (2) whether the prohibition in s 33(1) Insurance Act is only limited to policies relating to risks in Singapore. After hearing the submissions, I dismissed the appeal and now set out my grounds.
 2.The charge was as follows: 
You, International Testing Co Pte Ltd Registration no: 199404857Z are charged that you, between October 1994 and March 1996, without the approval of the Monetary Authority of Singapore, did carry on insurance business in Singapore as insurance agent for British United Provident Association Ltd, which was an insurer not entitled to carry on insurance business in Singapore, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under s 33(1) of the Insurance Act (Cap 142, 1994 Ed).
 3.
 The facts
The facts were simple and were agreed by the appellant. The whole of the prosecution case rested on the agreed facts. The appellant is a private limited company engaged in the business of consultant engineering services and general insurance. BUPA is an insurer based in the United Kingdom which offers health care insurance coverage. At the material times, BUPA was not registered with the Monetary Authority of Singapore under s 3 of the Insurance Act, and it was prohibited from carrying on any class of insurance business in Singapore. At the material times, Rosaline Margaret Yap Gim Leng (Rosaline Yap) and John William Wilson were the directors and shareholders of the appellant. Rosaline Yap was in charge of the general insurance business division in the company.
 4.Between October 1994 and March 1996, the appellant arranged for BUPA policies to be issued to: (1) PT Comismar Wanamaja (Comismar), a company incorporated in Indonesia; (2) David Quodling (Quodling), an Australian based in Malaysia.
 5.
 Comismar
In a letter dated 24 August 1994, the appellant informed BUPA that it was organising the health care insurance of the management and consultancy personnel of Comismar and conveyed information on Comismar. On 26 August 1994, BUPA replied and it was followed by an exchange of correspondence between BUPA and the appellant. On 3 October 1994, the appellant sent a letter to BUPA, enclosing the agreement duly signed by BUPA and the duly completed enrolment forms of five employees of Comismar. BUPA acknowledged receipt of the forms.
 6.
 Quodling
On 31 October 1995, the appellant, at the request of Quodling, sent to him literature on health insurance plans offered by BUPA and ProMedico, an insurer, and the application forms for both insurers. In the letter, the appellant asked Quodling to return the application form duly completed so that the application `could be handled and approval sought from the respective underwriters`. On 15 December 1995, the appellant forwarded to BUPA the application form completed by Quodling and the premium paid by Quodling. On 9 January 1996, the appellant informed Quodling that his application to BUPA had been accepted. The appellant further informed Quodling that the insurance cover had commenced on 1 January 1996 and that relevant documents would be despatched to him once the appellant received them. Subsequently the appellant received the membership certificate issued by BUPA for Quodling and in turn sent the certificate to Quodling.
 7.
 The defence
At the close of the prosecution`s case, the defence counsel argued that there was no case to answer. Section 33(1) of the Insurance Act only covered `Singapore policies` under First Schedule para 2(1) or offshore polices issued in Singapore under para 2(2), read with s 2(5) of the Act. The policies in respect of which the appellant was charged were policies issued by foreign issuers not in Singapore. Alternatively, even if s 33(1) applied to the insurance policies in question, the appellant had not committed any offence as it had not carried on insurance business as an agent for an insurer; it had not received proposals for polices, issued policies or received premiums on policies under s 2(5). It merely acted as a post-box to transmit information from BUPA. The district judge rejected the defence submission of no case to answer. He called upon the appellant to enter its defence. The appellant elected not to give evidence. The district judge convicted the appellant on the grounds that the appellant did in fact carry on insurance business in Singapore as an insurance agent under s 2(5). Further s 33(1) was not restricted only to `Singapore policies`.
 
 The appeal
Whether the appellant was acting as an insurance agent for BUPA within s 33(1) Insurance Act
 8.Section 33(1) prohibits the carrying on by insurance agents of insurance business in Singapore for an insurer not registered with MAS. BUPA, in response to queries from the Commercial Affairs Department in its investigations against the appellant, replied that the appellant `did not operate as a tied agent for BUPA International in Singapore but as an independent intermediary`. Counsel for the appellant argued that the appellant was not acting as an insurance agent for BUPA but as a postbox. I paid very little regard to BUPA`s claims that the appellant was not an insurance agent acting on its behalf. Rather the court should examine whether, having regard to the policy behind legislation and the course of conduct of the appellant, it was acting as an insurance agent within the meaning of s 33(1) read with s 2(5).
 9.The policy behind the Act is to regulate and supervise the conduct of insurance business in Singapore. The Act draws a distinction between an insurance agent and an insurance broker: see ss 2(5) and 33. However, the definition in s 2(5) is unhelpful as it merely provides that a Singapore insurance broker means a person who is or has been carrying on business as an insurance broker in Singapore. Section 33(2) provides inter alia that a Singapore insurance broker shall only negotiate a contract of insurance with a Singapore insurer acting in the course of his business as such; the penalty for violating this provision is a maximum fine of $10,000 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding a year.
 10.In my view, an insurance agent in s 2(5) is one who is acting as an agent of the insurer in negotiating, servicing or effecting insurance contracts whilst an insurance broker is an intermediary who is independent of any one insurer, and is generally an agent of the insured. In insurance law, the term insurance broker is understood to be one who is independent of and does not act for a designated insurer: Lewis E Davids, 
 Dictionary of Insurance 
, p 11 and 38; Clarke, 
 Law of Insurance Contracts 
 (3rd Ed, 1997) p 189. This is fortified by an examination of s 33. A heavier penalty is provided for an insurance agent carrying on business for an unauthorised insurer than for an insurance broker who negotiates a contract with an unauthorised insurer. An insurance agent within s 2(5) is one that acts on behalf of the insurer and is perceived by the legislature as being more culpable. Of course this does not mean that an insurance agent necessarily acts on the insurer`s behalf the whole of the time and he may in limited circumstances also act for the insured. In such a case, he will still be considered to be acting as an insurance agent under s 2(5). To hold otherwise would make the provisions of the regulatory legislation unworkable.
 11.Counsel argued that, since the appellant sent insurance brochures to Quodling of insurance proposals relating not only to BUPA but also to another insurer named ProMedico, the appellant was acting on behalf of Quodling. This was an untenable argument. The appellant did not hold itself out to act in the insured`s interest as would be expected of a broker acting on behalf of the insured in negotiating insurance contracts. There was no reason why the appellant could not be acting as an insurance agent for both BUPA and another insurer.
 12.In my view, the correspondence in the exhibits showed that the appellant was acting as an agent of the insurer. On the facts it was likely that the people carrying on business for the appellant company had no idea whether it was acting as an agent or as a broker when it was conducting business for clients, but, as I have pointed out earlier, the court had to determine whether the course of conduct undertaken by the appellant showed that it was acting as an agent or as a broker. The appellant did not hold himself out as an insurance broker when it was doing business and it was not registered as an insurance broker. The commission was paid by BUPA to the appellant at a rate of 10% on the introduction of new business and 10% on its renewal, not by the proposed insured. The appellant had authority from BUPA to receive proposals and forward them to BUPA for approval, and to communicate the explanation of the various terms found in the proposals to the proposed insured. In these circumstances, there was no doubt that the appellant was an insurance agent acting for BUPA.
 Scope of s 33(1) read with s 2(5) - Is the prohibition in s 33 read with s 2(5) confined to Singapore policies only?
 13.For ease of convenience, I set out the relevant provisions: 
33(1) No person shall, without the approval of the Authority
 , carry on insurance business in Singapore 
 as insurance agent for an insurer not entitled under this Act to carry on the business in question in Singapore; and a person contravening this subsection shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding $20,000 increased by a sum not exceeding $1,000 for every day on which he is proved to have done so, or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 2 years or to both. 
2(5) For the purpose of this Act, `Singapore insurer` and `Singapore insurance agent` mean a person who is or has been carrying on insurance business in Singapore as insurer and as insurance agent respectively, and `Singapore insurance broker` means a person who is or has been carrying on business as insurance broker in Singapore; and 
 references to carrying on insurance, or any class of insurance business, in Singapore include but include only the receipt of proposals for, or issuing of, policies in Singapore or the collection or receipt in Singapore of premiums on insurance polices 
.
 
First Schedule - Definition of Insurance Terms
 
2(1) Subject to this paragraph and section 15(30 and (4) of the Act, `Singapore policy`, in relation to any insurer, means a policy issued in the 
 course of the insurer`s business in Singapore and 
falling within one of the following descriptions:
 
(a) a life policy or personal accident policy in the case of which, at the date of issue of the policy and (if the policy was issued before then) at the date of the establishment of the insurer`s register of Singapore policies, the policy owner`s address is or was an address in Singapore; 
(b) in relation to direct general insurance (other than personal accident policies) and facultative general reinsurance, a policy in the case of which the risk arises in Singapore or where the insured is a person resident in Singapore or is a permanent establishment in Singapore; and 
 
 
(2) `Offshore policy`, in relation to any insurer, means any policy other than a Singapore policy, issued in the course of the insurer`s business in Singapore.
 14.The prosecution argued that s 2(5) read with s 33 are not confined only to Singapore policies but cover all offshore insurance policies as well. Counsel for the appellant argued that the provisions must be read with para 2 First Schedule which defines `Singapore policy` and `offshore policy`. The two policies in question were not `Singapore policies` as the insured were not persons with a address in Singapore or resident in Singapore or were a permanent establishment in Singapore or in respect of risks that arose in Singapore. He argued that BUPA did not issue Singapore policies nor cause offshore policies to be issued in Singapore; the policies were UK policies issued in the UK.
 15.I now address the first argument that s 33 is limited only to Singapore policies. This argument is clearly without any merit. Section 2(8) provides that the definitions set out in the First Schedule shall have effect for the construction of references to policies of insurance, policy owners and policy moneys. However on the plain reading of s 2(5), there is nothing which indicates that it applies only to Singapore policies. The First Schedule defines `Singapore policy` and `offshore policy` but these terms are not found in s 2(5) nor in s 33. I am unable to see how reference to the First Schedule provides any assistance. The three categories in s 2(5) refer to receipt of proposals for issuing of policies in Singapore or the collection or receipt in Singapore of premiums on `
 insurance policies 
`, and not only Singapore policies. There is no reason why the definitions in para 2 of the First Schedule should apply to s 2(5) or s 33.
 16.Also, as the district judge pointed out, it is anomalous to read a limitation to s 33. Under s 15(1) read with the First Schedule, a registered person or body has to keep a register of all `Singapore policies` and offshore policies issued in Singapore, both of which have to be issued in Singapore. It cannot be that on one hand a registered and authorised insurer has to keep registers of both Singapore and offshore policies and yet, on another hand, one can carry on insurance business in Singapore as an insurance agent with respect to offshore (but not Singapore) policies for an unauthorised user. It must be that the prohibition extends to carrying on insurance business with respect to all policies as insurance agent for all unauthorised and unregistered insurers.
 17.Counsel for the appellant had relied on the Preamble which provided that the Act was enacted to regulate insurance business in Singapore, and it could not have been intended to regulate foreign policies. With respect, the Preamble is inconclusive. There is nothing anomalous about the plain reading of ss 2(5) and 33. The Act does not regulate the carrying on of all insurance business, only the carrying on of insurance business 
 in Singapore as defined in s 2(5) 
.
 18.I am fortified by an examination of the legislative history. In 1986, s 2(5) was amended by deleting the words `Singapore policies` to replace them with the words `insurance policies`. It is clear that `insurance policies` in s 2(5) must refer to all insurance policies and not only to Singapore policies as defined in the First Schedule.
 19.The second argument raised by counsel was that even if s 33 covered offshore policies, the insurance policies were issued in the UK, and did not fall within s 2(5). I shall first consider the policy in relation to Quodling. This turns on the interpretation of the word `issuing` in s 2(5). `Policy` is defined in para 1 of the First Schedule to the Act, as including any contract of insurance whether or not embodied in or evidenced by an instrument in the form of a policy.
 20.`Issue` is not defined in the Act. The prosecution relied on 
Koon Wing Lau v Calwell
 
[1949] 
80 CLR 533
 which held that `to issue` meant that the document had to pass from the possession of the authorities either into his manual custody or under his control or into his legal possession so as to be at his command. The district judge accepted the interpretation that, for the insurance policy to be issued to a person, there had to be physical delivery of the document into the custody of the recipient or under his control.
 21.
 Koon Wing Lau v Calwell 
 was dealing with a case under the amended Australian Immigration Act 1949. The Act provided that a certificate of exemption `issued` by an authorised officer, to a prohibited immigrant or an immigrant required to pass a dictation test within a certain period, was deemed to be valid. When such a certificate was issued, he was not subject to provisions of the Act restricting entry into or stay in Australia. The importance of the certificate of exemption was that, if the certificate expired or was subsequently cancelled (on the stipulated grounds), he would be declared a prohibited immigrant and might be deported. The High Court of Australia held that the certificate was only `issued` within the 1949 Act if the certificate was delivered to the person named in the certificate. In that case, the High Court of Australia was dealing with the status of immigration of persons who could be deported. There was no doubt that, on such matters affecting his right to stay in Australia, the immigrant had to be informed as to whether he was allowed to remain in Australia. If the certificate was only signed by the authorities informing the immigrant and the certificate subsequently expired, he was liable to be deported. Hence it was justifiable to hold that the certificate had to be delivered to the immigrant.
 22.Here, we were concerned with a very different matter, viz. the issuing of insurance policies. The meaning of `issuing` in s 2(5) has to be construed not in the abstract but with reference to the use of the term in insurance law. An insurance contract is concluded when the duly completed proposal form is accepted by the insurers. Acceptance has to be communicated to the insured party. However, intimation by the insurer that the insured`s offer has been accepted can be in the form of the issuance of a policy to the insured: Tan Lee Meng, 
 Law of Insurance 
 (2nd Ed, 1997) at p 25. For the policy to be issued to the insured, there is no requirement that the policy must be both executed and delivered to the insured. Once the policy is executed to the insured, the policy is binding on both parties. This is illustrated in 
Roberts v Security Co Ltd
 
[1897] 1 QB 111
. In that case, a proposal for an insurance of goods against loss by burglary was made by the plaintiff to the defendant insurance company. The insurance company affixed the seal of the company to the policy which was in conformity to the proposal and the policy was duly signed. However, the policy remained in the hands of the insurance company and was not yet delivered when the loss occasioned by burglary occurred. The Court of Appeal held that the policy constituted a complete contract of insurance; the proposal was accepted when the policy was executed under the seal of the company.
 23.In this case, it was BUPA which had issued the policy of insurance to Quodling. The appellant sent a letter dated 9 January 1996 informing him that his application to BUPA had been accepted and the policy would be despatched to him once the appellant received it. This showed that it was BUPA which had executed the insurance policy in the United Kingdom and then delivered it to the appellant as agent in Singapore. By executing the policy, the policy was `issued` in the United Kingdom. The delivery of the policy was not necessary to constitute `issuing` within s 2(5). As such I disagreed with the district judge who found that the policy to Quodling was issued by the appellant in Singapore.
 24.However, the prohibition in s 2(5) is not confined only to the issuing of insurance policies in Singapore. There are two other categories in s 2(5): (1) receipt of proposals for policies in Singapore and (2) collection or receipt in Singapore of premiums on insurance policies.
 25.There was no doubt that the proposal for the insurance policy was received in Singapore. `Proposal` is not defined in the Act. The district judge accepted the meaning as, where there was a proposal form issued by the insurer, the proposal was the form which had been duly completed by the insured; and where there was no proposal form, the proposal was a document which could be construed as an offer made by the proposed insured to the insurer which, if accepted by the insurer, constituted a binding contract between the proposed insured and the insurer. I agreed with this interpretation of the word `proposal`.
 26.On 31 October 1995. Quodling received a BUPA application form from the appellant to be duly completed by himself. The appellant asked Quodling to return to it the completed forms so that they `may be handled and approval sought from the respective underwriters`. On an examination of the application form, it was indeed a proposal form which, when duly filled in and signed by the proposed assured and forwarded to the insurers, would operate as a formal offer by the proposed assured to the insurers. The duly completed form was received by the appellant who then forwarded it to BUPA on 15 December 1995. There was no doubt that the appellant had authority from BUPA to receive the proposal from the proposed insured, though it might not have authority to enter into the insurance contract on BUPA`s behalf. Hence there was receipt by the appellant on behalf of BUPA.
 27.It was doubtful whether there was receipt in Singapore of premiums on insurance policies. The appellant forwarded the duly completed application form together with 
 a bank draft drawn in pounds made in BUPA`s favour 
 for the first premium. Counsel for the defence argued that there was no receipt of moneys in Singapore as the premium took the form of a bank draft made to BUPA`s order for onward transmission. Receipt of the premiums only took place when the bank draft made in BUPA`s favour was delivered to BUPA. The appellant did not receive the premiums in Singapore. The appellant had authority to receive the bank draft and to transmit it to BUPA but it was essentially acting only as a conduit in this respect. Hence I found that there was no receipt of premiums in Singapore.
 28.In relation to Comismar, there was receipt by the appellant of BUPA`s proposal in Singapore. The agreement was signed on 13 September 1994 and it was sent to the appellant. On 3 October 1994, the appellant sent to BUPA a letter enclosing an agreement duly signed by both Comismar and BUPA and the duly completed enrolment forms of five employees of Comismar. The insurance agreement was contained in the agreement duly signed by both parties.
 29.The result was that the conviction of the appellant should be upheld, but not on all the grounds relied on by the district judge. I found that the offence under s 33(1) of the Act was contravened on two occasions; the first was when the proposal for the insurance policy in relation to Quodling was received in Singapore on 15 December 1995 and the second was when the proposal for the insurance policy in relation to Comismar was received in Singapore on 3 October 1994. Both proposals were received by the appellant as BUPA`s agent for onward transmission to BUPA.
 30.
 Sentence
The offence under s 33(1) of the Act is punishable with up to $20,000 fine increased by up to $1,000 for every day on which the offender is proved to have continued the offence, or up to two years imprisonment or to both. The district judge sentenced the appellant to an $18,000 fine, increased by a sum of $1,000 for every day of the four days it contravened s 33(1). With respect, I was of the view that the sentence was manifestly excessive. The appellant had contravened s 33(1) in relation only to two insurance policies relating to two different clients. The offence stretched from October 1994 to March 1996 but the appellant`s carrying on insurance business in Singapore was limited only to receiving proposals from the proposed insured and forwarding them to BUPA. The insured`s interest was not shown to be affected nor was the operation over such a prolonged period. It was not carrying on a large scale insurance business for BUPA. It was the appellant`s first conviction. I accepted that the appellant did not know that its manner of carrying on business contravened s 33. The public interest was not adversely affected. In the circumstances the fine should be reduced to $10,000. Given my earlier finding that the offence was committed only on the receipt of Quodling`s proposal in Singapore, as well as the receipt of Comismar`s proposals in Singapore, the contravention of s 33(1) took place only on two occasions, as opposed to the four occasions found by the district judge. Accordingly the sentence was reduced to a $10,000 fine increased by a sum of $1,000 for each of the two days the appellant violated s 33(1), making a total sentence of $12,000. The appeal against the sentence was allowed to this extent.","1998-07-21 00:00:00","SG High Court"
